✅ Objective:
To set up a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally using Minikube, verify its status, and deploy a sample application to ensure the cluster is functioning correctly.

🧰 Tools and Technologies Used:
Minikube – For creating the local Kubernetes cluster

kubectl – Kubernetes command-line tool

Linux VM – As the host environment (used --driver=none)

Browser – For accessing the Kubernetes Dashboard and sample app

🔍 Steps Performed:
1. Installed Prerequisites
   Installed kubectl
   Installed Minikube
2. Started the Minikube Cluster
   Since I was working on a Linux VM, I used the none driver:minikube start --driver=none

  kubectl get nodes
  kubectl cluster-info
4. Launched the Kubernetes Dashboard (Optional)
